As a user of a SortedLinkedList library, 
I would expect it to be easy to use, versatile, 
and adhere to best practices for clean and maintainable code.

These types of libraries is useful as many aspects. Some has decribed below :-

Dynamic data structure: A linked list is a dynamic arrangement so it can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating memory. So there is no need to give the initial size of the linked list.

No memory wastage: In the Linked list, efficient memory utilization can be achieved since the size of the linked list increase or decrease at run time so there is no memory wastage and there is no need to pre-allocate the memory.

Implementation: Linear data structures like stacks and queues are often easily implemented using a linked list.

Insertion and Deletion Operations: Insertion and deletion operations are quite easier in the linked list. There is no need to shift elements after the insertion or deletion of an element only the address present in the next pointer needs to be updated. 

Flexible: This is because the elements in Linked List  are not stored in contiguous memory locations unlike the array.
